**Take a number as an input from the user.
**Pass the number as argument to the function.
**Take 2 variables i and count, set i to 1 and count to 0.
**While count's not equal to the number n, increment i by 1.
**Check if the number i is prime or not, if prime increment count by 1.
**When i equals count, exit the while loop and return i.
